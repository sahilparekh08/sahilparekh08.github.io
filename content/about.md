## Hey!👋🏽

Welcome!!

I am Sahil (he/him), a technology enthusiast driven by a passion for learning and solving real-world problems using cutting-edge technologies and design principles. I am deeply curious about employing diverse design techniques and methods to effectively address challenges. My approach always begins with considering multiple perspectives while solving problems, the most efficient path to reach a solution comprehensively and the learning involved in the same. I am particularly enthusiastic about working on system design, complex technical architectures, unbiased machine learning algorithms, and cloud technologies.
