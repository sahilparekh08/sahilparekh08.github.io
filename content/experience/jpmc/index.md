### Role
I started my journey with JP Morgan Chase & Co. in their investment banking regulatory reporting department as an intern during my last undergraduate semester. I started by understanding the domain of regulatory reporting and the trade life cycle. Since our team handled real-time regulatory reporting for the investment firm, I got to work on real-time low-latency systems, streaming and batch frameworks and cloud microservice architectures with multiple scalable components. I also worked on its own custom streaming and batch framework to gain a processing throughput of millions of messages a day with sub-second end-to-end latencies per message. I also used docker and Kubernetes to deploy our microservices on a private cloud infrastructure and on-premise data centers. With developing these models from scratch, I learnt a lot about system design, analysing frameworks, streaming and batch systems and how to find, analyse and remediate performance bottlenecks.
