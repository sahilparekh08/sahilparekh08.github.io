### Role

I was a Research Assistant with Dr. Linh Thi Xuan Phan where I studied and built scheduling algorithms on Linux based multi-core platforms for safely scheduling real-time tasks during Summer 2024. Her I gained experience on writing and debugging kernel code, building system calls and developing and testing new kerbel scheduling policies such as EDF. I also utilised technologies like Memguard and Intel-CAT for resource allocation and management between tasks running on the kerbel.

I have also served as a Teaching Assistant for the following courses:
1. CIS 3310 (Fall 2023 and CIS 5510 (Spring 2024) Networks and Security course instructed by Dr. Sebastian Angel
2. CIS 5050 (Fall 2024) Software Systems course instructed by Dr. Linh Thi Xuan Phan
