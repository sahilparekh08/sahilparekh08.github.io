I started by understanding the domain of regulatory reporting and the trade life cycle. Since our team handled real-time regulatory reporting for the investment firm, I got to work on real-time low-latency systems, streaming and batch frameworks and cloud microservice architectures with multiple scalable components. I also worked on its own custom streaming and batch framework to gain a processing throughput of about 4 million messages a day with a average of 0.17 seconds of end-to-end latency per message. We also used docker and Kubernetes to deploy most of our microservices on cloud and some services on our data centers as required by regulatory authorities. There is also a complex networking structure in a hybrid network. With developing these models from scratch, I learnt a lot about system design, analysing frameworks, streaming and batch systems and how to find, analyse and remediate performance bottlenecks.</p><h3 id=positions>Positions<a href=#positions class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><ol><li>Software Engineer II (Feb 2023 - Jul 2023)</li><li>Software Engineer I (Aug 2020 - Jan 2023)</li><li>Software Engineer Intern (Jan 2020 - Jul 2020)</li></ol><p>Some of the technologies I used extensively:</p><ol><li>Languages: Java, SQL, bash, Python</li><li>Frameworks and Technologies: Spring, JUnit, Mockito, Apache Kafka, FIX Engine, MongoDB, EhCache, Oracle BDB, Hadoop, Oracle Exadata</li><li>Tools: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Jenkins, Control-M, Splunk, Dynatrace, Gradle, Maven, Git</li></ol></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>Â© 2024 Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
